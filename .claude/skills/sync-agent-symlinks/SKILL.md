# sync-agent-symlinks Skill

Keep agent-facing skill and agent structures synchronized with `ai-specs/skills` and `ai-specs/agents` as the canonical sources.

Use this skill after any change in `ai-specs/skills` or `ai-specs/agents` (new, removed, renamed, or moved), especially when you need to avoid stale or broken symlinks.

## Scope and Safety Rules

- Canonical sources are `ai-specs/skills` and `ai-specs/agents`.
- Mirror targets are:
  - `.agent/skills` and `.agent/agents`
  - `.claude/skills` and `.claude/agents`
  - `.cursor/skills` and `.cursor/agents`
- Manage only entries that are symlinks to `../../ai-specs/skills/<skill-name>` or `../../ai-specs/agents/<agent-name>.md`.
- Do not delete non-symlink directories in mirror targets unless the user explicitly asks.
- Never overwrite a real directory automatically; report it as a conflict.

## Workflow

### Step 1 - Build inventories

Collect three inventories:

1. Canonical items from `ai-specs/skills/*/SKILL.md` and `ai-specs/agents/*.md`
2. Mirror entries in `.agent/skills` and `.agent/agents`
3. Mirror entries in `.claude/skills` and `.claude/agents`
4. Mirror entries in `.cursor/skills` and `.cursor/agents`

From mirror entries, classify:
- `linked`: valid symlink pointing to existing canonical skill
- `broken`: symlink target missing
- `orphan`: symlink points to canonical namespace but skill no longer exists
- `conflict`: non-symlink entry with same name as canonical skill
- `external`: entry not managed by canonical symlink policy (leave unchanged)

### Step 2 - Compute sync plan

For each mirror target:

- `to_add`: canonical skills missing in mirror target
- `to_fix`: broken canonical symlinks that should be recreated
- `to_remove`: orphan canonical symlinks with no canonical source
- `to_skip`: conflicts and external entries (report only)

### Step 3 - Apply sync safely

Apply changes in this order:

1. Add missing symlinks:
   - `<mirror>/skills/<skill-name> -> ../../ai-specs/skills/<skill-name>`
   - `<mirror>/agents/<agent-name>.md -> ../../ai-specs/agents/<agent-name>.md`
2. Fix broken canonical symlinks:
   - Remove broken link and recreate the same canonical link
3. Remove orphan canonical symlinks:
   - Remove symlink only if it points to canonical namespace and skill is gone

Never remove:
- non-symlink directories
- files not under canonical symlink policy

### Step 4 - Verify integrity

After changes:

- Confirm every canonical skill exists in both mirrors as a valid symlink, or is explicitly listed as conflict.
- Confirm no broken canonical symlinks remain.
- Confirm external entries remain untouched.

### Step 5 - Report results

Return a concise sync report:

- Canonical items (skills/agents) count
- Per mirror target:
  - added
  - fixed
  - removed
  - conflicts
  - skipped external entries
- Remaining blockers (if any)

## Add/Remove Scenarios

### Scenario A - New skill or agent added in ai-specs

Expected behavior:
- Add missing symlink in `.agent/skills` or `.agent/agents`
- Add missing symlink in `.claude/skills` or `.claude/agents`
- Add missing symlink in `.cursor/skills` or `.cursor/agents`
- Verify all links resolve to canonical folder/file

### Scenario B - Skill or agent removed from ai-specs

Expected behavior:
- Remove orphan canonical symlink from `.agent/skills` or `.agent/agents`
- Remove orphan canonical symlink from `.claude/skills` or `.claude/agents`
- Remove orphan canonical symlink from `.cursor/skills` or `.cursor/agents`
- Keep non-canonical directories untouched and report them

## Command Patterns (Reference)

Use equivalent commands for your environment:

```bash
# list canonical skill directories and agent files
ls ai-specs/skills
ls ai-specs/agents

# inspect mirror entries with link metadata
ls -la .agent/skills
ls -la .agent/agents
ls -la .claude/skills
ls -la .claude/agents
ls -la .cursor/skills
ls -la .cursor/agents

# add canonical link (example for agent and skill)
ln -s ../../ai-specs/skills/<skill-name> .agent/skills/<skill-name>
ln -s ../../ai-specs/agents/<agent-name>.md .agent/agents/<agent-name>.md
# Note: On Windows PowerShell, use `New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink` or `cmd /c mklink`

# remove orphan canonical link
rm .agent/skills/<skill-name>
rm .agent/agents/<agent-name>.md
```

## Red Flags

Never:
- treat `ai-specs` as non-canonical
- auto-delete real directories in mirror targets
- leave broken canonical symlinks after sync
- silently skip conflicts without reporting

Always:
- analyze before changing
- apply minimal safe changes
- preserve non-canonical entries
- provide a final sync report with blockers
